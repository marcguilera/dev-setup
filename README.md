# Dev setup

Small script to help setup everything I need to get a computer up un running for development (`android-sdk`, `dart`, `IntelliJ`, `npm`, etc.)

Simply run the `./run.sh` script and follow the instructions on the screen.

There are a couple of predefined setups:

* Frontend
* Backend
* Mobile
* Extras

Currently it only works for Mac since it relies on `brew`.
